## Database Design

### Data Model

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

![screenshot](documentation/erd.png)

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Using your defined models, create an ERD with the relationships identified. A couple of recommendations for building your own free ERDs:

- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning)
- [Draw.io](https://draw.io)

Looking for an interactive version of your ERD? Consider using a [`Mermaid flowchart`](https://mermaid.live). To simplify the process, you can ask ChatGPT (or similar) the following prompt:

> ChatGPT Prompt:
> "Generate a Markdown syntax Mermaid ERD using my Django models"
> [paste-your-django-models-into-ChatGPT]

The "Boutique Ado" sample ERD in Markdown syntax using Mermaid can be seen below as an example.

**NOTE**: A Markdown Preview tool doesn't show the interactive ERD; you must first commit/push the code to your GitHub repository in order to see it live in action.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I have used `Mermaid` to generate an interactive ERD of my project.

⚠️ RECOMMENDED ⚠️

Alternatively, or in addition to, a more comprehensive ERD can be auto-generated once you're at the end of your development stages, just before you submit. Follow the steps below to obtain a thorough ERD that you can include. Feel free to leave the steps below in the README for future use to yourself.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:

- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```

- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- drag the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

⚠️ TIP ⚠️

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/AshLaw96/fit-track/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/AshLaw96/fit-track/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCow" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (_max ~60% of stories_)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (_~20% of stories_)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (_the rest ~20% of stories_)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://fit-track-project-8ab24fa880fe.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

🛑 !!! ATTENTION AshLaw96 !!! 🛑

⚠️ DO NOT update the environment variables to your own! These should never be public; only use the demo values below! ⚠️

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (_where applicable_) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- _replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located_

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (_recommended_):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (_replace `app_name` with your app name_)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- _Optional_: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
  - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
  - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (_verify your password and account_)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords** (_search for it at the top, if not_).
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
  - Any custom name, such as "Django" or `fit-track`
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
  - Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
  - If your 16-character password contains _spaces_, make sure to remove them entirely.
  - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
  - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
  - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
  - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django’s "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```

### Local Development

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### `npm run build` fails to minify

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

🛑 !!! ATTENTION AshLaw96 !!! 🛑

⚠️ DO NOT update the environment variables to your own! These should never be public; only use the demo values below! ⚠️

🛑 --- END --- 🛑

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user-inserts-own-aws-access-key-id")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user-inserts-own-aws-secret-access-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user-inserts-own-gmail-host-api-key")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret")  # only if using Stripe Webhooks

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (_Windows/Linux_) or `⌘+C` (_Mac_)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (_if applicable_): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (_repeat for each file_)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- _repeat this action for each model you wish to backup_
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default _admin_ or _users_ data with confidential information.

### Local VS Deployment

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss any differences between the local version you've developed, and the live deployment site. Generally, there shouldn't be [m]any major differences, so if you honestly cannot find any differences, feel free to use the following example:

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.

## Credits

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In the following sections, you need to reference where you got your content, media, and any extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials (which is totally acceptable), however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid potential plagiarism.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

### Content

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

### Media

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links to any media files borrowed from elsewhere (images, videos, audio, etc.). If you're the owner (or a close acquaintance) of some/all media files, then make sure to specify this information. Let the assessors know that you have explicit rights to use the media files within your project. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every media file used, not just a generic link to the main site, unless it's AI-generated artwork.

Looking for some media files? Here are some popular sites to use. The list of examples below is by no means exhaustive. Within the Code Institute Slack community, you can find more "free media" links by sending yourself (or Slackbot) the following command: `!freemedia`.
